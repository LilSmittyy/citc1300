    <h2>Stealth-Based Gameplay</h2>
   <p>Stealth plays a crucial role in Whispering Dead, defining the way players approach both exploration and combat. Unlike many traditional survival games that emphasize constant action, Whispering Dead encourages players to think critically and plan their moves. Mastering stealth is not just an option—it’s often the difference between life and death in this world. The game’s mechanics are designed to reward players who utilize stealth effectively, offering numerous ways to avoid danger rather than confront it head-on. Stealth involves more than just crouching to stay hidden. Players must be aware of their surroundings at all times, listening for zombie noises, human threats, and environmental cues. Factors such as loud breathing, stepping on noisy surfaces like broken glass, or even dropping items can alert nearby enemies. This level of detail forces players to be cautious in every action, requiring them to stay patient and thoughtful as they navigate through dangerous areas. The game’s realistic sound design ensures that stealth isn’t just about staying out of sight but also about minimizing noise and making smart decisions to avoid detection. The game also provides various tools to enhance stealth-based gameplay. Weapons like bows, crossbows, and silenced firearms allow players to eliminate threats quietly, while traps and distractions, such as throwing rocks or setting off car alarms, can divert enemies. Players must be strategic in their use of these tools, planning when and how to deploy them to avoid detection and gain an upper hand.

    <h2>Sound Control</h2>
   <p> In Whispering Dead, every action you take generates noise. Whether it’s opening a door, rummaging through supplies, or breaking into a house, these sounds can draw unwanted attention. The game’s sound-based detection system ensures that enemies respond to noise quickly, so even minor actions can have major consequences. Opening a door too quickly or smashing a window will create a loud sound that might alert nearby zombies or human enemies.

    To remain undetected, players must take slow, deliberate actions. Silent looting, crouching while moving, and using quieter weapons like bows or crossbows are key strategies for keeping a low profile. Additionally, certain items like lockpicks can break and cause noise, so careful tool management is necessary. Controlling the noise you make, whether by moving slowly or choosing quieter ways to interact with the environment, is essential for staying alive in this dangerous world.
    </p>
    <h2>Managing Stamina</h2>
   <p>Stamina management is crucial for maintaining silence in Whispering Dead. When your character runs out of stamina, their breathing becomes labored and loud, significantly increasing the risk of being detected by nearby zombies or bandits. Running or exerting yourself too much drains stamina quickly, forcing you to take breaks and rest before continuing on. The louder your breathing, the more likely you are to attract threats in the area, even if you are hiding.

    The key to staying silent is to pace yourself. Crouching or walking slowly reduces stamina loss, allowing you to keep a lower profile. Overexerting yourself, especially in high-risk areas, can lead to disastrous consequences. By maintaining stamina, you not only reduce noise but also ensure that you're always ready to sprint or fight if necessary. Managing your physical state is just as important as controlling your movement in this world.</p>
