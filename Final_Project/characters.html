    <h2>Evolving as a Survivor</h2>
    <p>Character progression is a vital aspect of Whispering Dead, allowing players to develop their skills and abilities as they navigate the challenges of a post-apocalyptic world. Through a detailed level-up system, players can enhance their characters, making them more effective in combat, stealth, and survival. As players face various threats, their growth is not just about becoming stronger but also about learning to adapt to the ever-changing environment and the dangers that lurk within it.</p>

    <h2>Level-Up System</h2>
    <p>As players engage in various activities—such as crafting, looting, killing zombies, and even interacting with other players—they earn experience points (XP). Gaining XP allows characters to level up, unlocking new capabilities and enhancing existing attributes. Each level provides players with the opportunity to invest in different skills, allowing for a personalized gameplay experience tailored to individual playstyles. This system encourages players to explore the vast game world and experiment with different strategies to maximize their efficiency in survival</p>

<h2>Attributes and Skills</h2>
    <p>Players can choose to improve several core attributes during level-ups, including</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strength: Increases carrying capacity, melee damage, and the ability to break through obstacles.</li>
        <li>Stamina: Enhances running speed, jumping ability, and stamina recovery over time.</li>
        <li>Health: Boosts overall health, reduces the effects of injuries, and decreases the chance of infection.</li>    
        <li>Stealth: Improves movement quietness, making it easier to avoid detection by zombies and other players when looting or traversing noisy surfaces</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, players can invest in crafting and looting skills. Crafting skills ensure that weapons and tools last longer, while looting skills increase the speed of collecting items and enhance the likelihood of finding rare resources. These skill choices significantly impact how players approach encounters and resource management, allowing for varied strategies and gameplay styles.</p>
