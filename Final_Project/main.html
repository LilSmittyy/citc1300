    <h2>Where the Idea Came From</h2>
    <p>Whispering Dead was inspired by the ambitious yet disappointing game The Day Before. Initially, The Day Before captivated survival game enthusiasts with promises of a vast, immersive world filled with intense mechanics and dynamic encounters. However, after entering alpha, players quickly realized that the game was far from completion, leading to mounting concerns. As delays persisted and the developers failed to provide substantial updates, many began to suspect that the project was a scam. Eventually, the developers deleted the game and absconded with players’ money, prompting Steam to issue refunds to hundreds of thousands of frustrated customers. Recognizing the gap left by this unmet potential, Im making a game called "Whispering Dead" to deliver the gripping and realistic survival experience that players had hoped for and wanted. By focusing on stealth-based gameplay and a fully dynamic environment, Whispering Dead aims to fulfill the promises that The Day Before could not, ensuring players a rewarding and immersive journey.</p>

    <h2>Survive the Undead, Outsmart the Living</h2>
    
    <p>Whispering Dead transports players into a post-apocalyptic world where every decision and every step matters. In this unforgiving landscape, zombies aren’t the only danger—wildlife, rival survivors, and even the changing seasons present unique challenges. Rather than relying on brute force, survival in Whispering Dead demands resourcefulness and strategic thinking. Players must scavenge for supplies, craft essential tools, and use the environment to their advantage, all while avoiding detection from the relentless undead. Stealth, patience, and caution are your most valuable weapons.</p>
    <h2>Adapt, Evolve, and Endure in a Changing World</h2>
    
    <p>As time passes, the world evolves around you. Power outages will plunge cities into darkness, and the seasons will affect everything from zombie behavior to available resources. Spring may bring a bounty of food, but Winter’s harsh cold could mean death if you’re unprepared. With a massive open world to explore—featuring cities, forests, and rural outposts—you’ll have to constantly adapt to stay ahead of the dangers lurking in every corner. Welcome to Whispering Dead, where the only certainty is that death is never far away.</p> </section>
